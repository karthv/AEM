5. View Packages on AEM

Navigate to Package Manager on local AEM instance:    http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp

We can see the following 5 packages installed:



6. Go to the AEM Sites Console: http://localhost:4502/sites.html

The myprojectSite will be listed in the sites, which includes two content pages, one for English and one for French.



 

 

7. Open up any one of the content pages in the Sites editor: 

    http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/myproject/en.html



 

We will build the Core module independently from the rest of the project with the below commands from the terminal:

     cd aem-guides-myproject/core/

     mvn -PautoInstallBundle clean install

 



 

8. Go to http://localhost:4502/system/console/bundles  we will be able to see the bundle installed and active.



 

9. The OSGi bundle is a jar that deploys to the AEM repository as an embedded part of the ui.apps module. The 'physical' location of the jar can be seen in CRXDE-Lite:

 



         

Notice that core.wcm.components.all zip is included as a sub-package. This will deploy the Core Components package along with the MYPROJECT code each time.
