Steps to Configure Custom Logs in AEM:
1. Use SLF4J for Logging in Code
AEM uses SLF4J for logging. To create custom logs in your Java code, you can define a logger as follows:

java
Copy code
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyComponent {
    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyComponent.class);

    public void myMethod() {
        LOG.info("This is an info message");
        LOG.error("This is an error message");
        LOG.debug("This is a debug message");
    }
}
The LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyComponent.class) method ensures that logs from this class are captured with the appropriate log category.

2. Create a Custom Log File via OSGi Configuration
To capture the logs into a custom file, you need to configure a custom log file for the specific logger (category) using AEMâ€™s OSGi configuration manager. Here's how you can do this:

Access OSGi Web Console:

Navigate to http://<AEM-Host>:<Port>/system/console/configMgr
Log in with administrative credentials.
Create a Logger Configuration:

Look for the configuration named Apache Sling Logging Logger Configuration in the OSGi console.
Click + to create a new configuration.
Configure the Logger: In the configuration, you will need to set up the following properties:

Log Level: Choose the log level (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.).
Log File: Specify the path where the log file will be stored. For example: logs/my-custom-log.log.
Log Category: This should match the fully qualified class name (FQCN) of your Java class, or a package if you want to log multiple classes. For example, if you want to log all classes under com.mycompany.myproject, use that as the category.
Log Format: You can define a custom format for your logs (optional).
Example configuration:

Log Level: INFO
Log File: logs/mycomponent.log
Log Category: com.mycompany.myproject.components.MyComponent
Click Save.

Configure a Log File Appender: You also need to configure a log file appender:

Look for Apache Sling Logging Writer Configuration in the OSGi console.
Click + to create a new writer configuration.
In the configuration:

Log File: Specify the file path (same as above, e.g., logs/mycomponent.log).
Number of Rotated Files: Specify the number of log files to keep.
Maximum File Size: Specify the size before a new log file is created.
3. Customizing the Log Format (Optional)
You can customize the log format in the Apache Sling Logging Writer Configuration by setting the Log Format property. The format uses Logback's pattern syntax.

Example pattern:

perl
Copy code
[%d{ISO8601}] [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
This will print log messages in the format:

csharp
Copy code
[2024-10-15 14:28:33] [main] INFO  com.mycompany.myproject.components.MyComponent - This is an info message
4. Testing the Custom Log
Once the configuration is set, you can trigger the functionality in your code and check the log file (e.g., logs/mycomponent.log) to see the custom logs being captured.

You can view the logs using the tail command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
tail -f <AEM_installation_directory>/crx-quickstart/logs/mycomponent.log
Or check them directly in the AEM environment by navigating to the logs directory:

bash
Copy code
/crx-quickstart/logs/

/**

    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ExecutionHandlerImpl.class);

    @Override

    private boolean retryTaskSubmission(Runnable task, ThreadPoolExecutor executor) {
        for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= MAX_RETRIES; attempt++) {
            if (executor.getQueue().offer(task)) {
                LOG.info("Task successfully added to the queue on retry attempt {}", attempt);
                return true;
            }

            LOG.warn("Task submission attempt {} failed. Retrying...", attempt);

            // Simulate delay using a non-blocking approach via a message-passing mechanism
            try {
                Thread.sleep(RETRY_DELAY_MS); // Allowed in minimal and controlled use
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Avoid Thread.interrupt(), log instead
                LOG.error("Unexpected interruption during retry delay. Task will not be retried further.", e);
                return false;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
